In2WebDev

In2WebDev is a project I built as a portfolio to showcase my web development skills and offer website building and maintenance services. This site serves as both a personal portfolio and a potential platform to attract freelance work for small web applications.
This App has been deployed using Azure Static Web app. This was pure to explore how to do this, and I have since removed it to complete the build before actual deployment.

Home Page: Introduces the In2WebDev platform and its services.
Page Options: Explores the various build options available for custom projects.
Portfolio: Displays my previous work and accomplishments.
Contact Form: Allows users to reach out for work inquiries or collaborations.

Technologies Used
React.js: Frontend library for building the UI.
React Router: For navigating between different pages.
CSS: Used to style the components and layout.

Project Structure
App.jsx: Main component that defines routes and displays key sections of the site.
Pages: Includes the different pages for the site (Home, Page Options, Portfolio, Contact).
